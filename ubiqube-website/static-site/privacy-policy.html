			<h2>7. What rights do you have</h2>

			<ul class="list-default">
				<li>the right of access to Personal Data relating to you;&nbsp;</li>

				<li>the right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing;</li>

			</ul>
			<p>These rights are explained in more detail below, but if you have any comments, concerns or complaints about our use of your Personal Data, please contact us (see ‘How to contact Us’ below at section 17). We will respond to any rights that you exercise within a month of receiving your request, unless the request is particularly complex or cumbersome, in which case we will respond within three months (we will inform you within the first month if it will take longer than one month for us to respond). Where a response is required from us within a particular time period pursuant to Data Protection Legislation, we will respond within that time period.</p>
			<p><strong>7.1 Right of access to Personal Data relating to you</strong></p>
			<p>You may ask to see what Personal Data we hold about you and be provided with:</p>
			<ul class="list-default">
				<li>a summary of such Personal Data and the categories of Personal Data held (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2 above);</li>
				<li>details of the purpose for which it is being or is to be processed (see Section 3 above);&nbsp;</li>
				<li>details of the recipients or classes of recipients to whom it is or may be disclosed, including if they are overseas and what protections are used for those oversea transfers (see Section 10 below);&nbsp;</li>
				<li>details of the period for which it is held or the criteria we use to determine how long it is held (see Section 15 below);</li>
				<li>details of your rights, including the rights to rectification, erasure, restriction or objection to the processing (set out in this Section 7);&nbsp;</li>
				<li>any information available about the source of that data (see Section 2 above);</li>
				<li>whether or not we carry out automated decision-making, or profiling, and where we do, information about the logic involved and the envisaged outcome or consequences of that decision making or profiling (See Section 7.4); and</li>
				<li>where your Personal Data is transferred out of the EEA, what safeguards are in place (see Section 10 below).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Details in respect of the above points are all set out in this Privacy Policy; however, if you need further clarification, please contact us (see ‘How to contact Us’ below at section 17).</p>
			<p>Requests for your Personal Data must be made to us (see ‘How to contact Us’ below at section 17) specifying what Personal Data you need access to, and a copy of such request may be kept by us for our legitimate purposes in managing the Service. To help us find the information easily, please give us as much information as possible about the type of information you would like to see. If, to comply with your request, we would have to disclose information relating to or identifying another person, we may need to obtain the consent of that person, if possible. If we cannot obtain consent, we may need to withhold that information or edit the data to remove the identity of that person, if possible.</p>
			<p>There are certain types of data which we are not obliged to disclose to you, which include Personal Data which records our intentions in relation to any negotiations with you where disclosure would be likely to prejudice those negotiations. We are also entitled to refuse a data access request from you where (i) such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character (in this case, if we decide to provide you with the Personal Data requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to account for administrative costs of doing so), or (ii) we are entitled to do so pursuant to Data Protection Legislation.</p>
			<p><strong>7.2 Right to update your Personal Data or correct any mistakes in your Personal Data</strong></p>
			<p>You can require us to correct any mistakes in your Personal Data which we hold free of charge. If you would like to do this, please:</p>
			<ul class="list-default">
			<li>email or write to us (see ‘How can you contact us’ below);</li>
			<li>let us have enough information to identify you (e.g. name, registration details); and</li>
			<li>let us know the information that is incorrect and what it should be replaced with.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If we are required to update your Personal Data, we will inform recipients to whom that Personal Data has been disclosed (if any), unless this proves impossible or has a disproportionate effort.</p>
			<p>It is your responsibility that all of the Personal Data provided to us is accurate and complete. If any information you have given us changes, please let us know as soon as possible (see ‘How to contact Us’ below at section 17).</p>
			<p><strong>7.3 Right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing</strong></p>
			<p>We have a legitimate interest to send you electronic communications in connection with the Service and related matters (which may include but shall not be limited to newsletters, announcement of new features etc. and which may also appear on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or Instagram.). We may also ask you for your consent to send you direct marketing from time to time. You may be able to select your preferences with respect to direct marketing when registering Your Account. We may also ask you different questions for different services, including competitions. We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</p>
			<p>You can ask us to stop contacting you for direct marketing purposes. If you would like to do this, please:</p>
			<ul class="list-default">
			<li>Click on ‘unsubscribe’ on an email (this will be instantaneous);</li>
			<li>Respond ‘stop’ on an SMS (this will be instantaneous) to a number notified to you; or</li>
			<li>Send an email via ‘How to contact Us’ below at section 17 (this can take up to 5 working days).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will provide you with information on action taken on a request to stop direct marketing – this may be in the form of a response email confirming that you have ‘unsubscribed’. Unsubscribing from direct marketing does not unsubscribe you from essential electronic communications in respect of the administration of Your Account.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>7.4 Rights in relation to automated decision taking</strong></p>
			<p>You may ask us to ensure that, if we are evaluating you, we don’t base any decisions solely on an automated process and have any decision reviewed by a member of staff. Profiling may occur in relation to your Personal Data for the purposes of targeted advertising and de-targeting you from specified advertising. This allows us to tailor our advertising to the appropriate customers and helps to minimise the risk of you receiving unwanted advertising. These rights will not apply in all circumstances, for example where the decision is (i) authorised or required by law, (ii) necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us, or (ii) is based on your explicit consent. In all cases, we will endeavour that steps have been taken to safeguard your interests.</p>
			<p><strong>7.5 Right to restrict or prevent processing of Personal Data</strong></p>
			<p>In accordance with Data Processing Legislation, you may request that we stop processing your Personal Data temporarily if:&nbsp;</p>
			<ul class="list-default">
			<li>you do not think that your Personal Data is accurate (but we may start processing again once we have checked and confirmed that it is accurate);</li>
			<li>the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your Personal Data;</li>
			<li>we no longer need the Personal Data for our processing; or</li>
			<li>you have objected to processing because you believe that your interests should override the basis upon which we process your Personal Data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you exercise your right to restrict us from processing your Personal Data, we will continue to process the Personal Data if:</p>
			<ul class="list-default">
			<li>you consent to such processing;</li>
			<li>the processing is necessary for the exercise or defence of legal claims;</li>
			<li>the processing is necessary for the protection of the rights of other individuals or legal persons; or</li>
			<li>the processing is necessary for public interest reasons.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>7.6 Right to data portability</strong></p>
			<p>In accordance with Data Protection Legislation, you may ask for an electronic copy of your Personal Data that you have provided to us and which we hold electronically, or for us to provide this directly to another party. This right only applies to Personal Data that you have provided to us – it does not extend to data generated by us. In addition, the right to data portability also only applies where:</p>
			<ul class="list-default">
			<li>the processing is based on your consent or for the performance of a contract; and</li>
			<li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>7.7 Right to erasure</strong></p>
			<p>In accordance with Data Protection Legislation, you can ask us (please see ‘How to contact Us’ below at section 17) to erase your Personal Data where:</p>
			<ul class="list-default">
			<li>you do not believe that we need your Personal Data in order to process it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy;</li>
			<li>if you had given us consent to process your Personal Data, you withdraw that consent and we cannot otherwise legally process your Personal Data;&nbsp;</li>
			<li>you object to our processing and we do not have any legal basis for continuing to process your Personal Data;&nbsp;</li>
			<li>your Personal Data has been processed unlawfully or have not been erased when it should have been; or</li>
			<li>The Personal Data has to be erased to comply with law.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We may continue to process your Personal Data in certain circumstances in accordance with Data Protection Legislation (i.e. where we have a legal justification to continue to hold such Personal Data, such as it being within our legitimate business interest to do so (e.g. retaining evidence of billing information etc.). Where you have requested the erasure of your Personal Data, we will inform recipients to whom that Personal Data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will also inform you about those recipients if you request it.</p>
			<p><strong>7.8 Right to complain to the DPC</strong></p>
			<p>If you do not think that we have processed your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, please contact us in the first instance. If you are not satisfied, you can complain to the DPC or exercise any of your other rights pursuant to Data Protection Legislation. Information about how to do this is available on the DPC website at <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/">dataprotection.ie</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>8. Withdrawal of Consent</h2>
			<p>If you no longer consent to our processing of Your Data (in respect of any matter referred to in this Privacy Policy as requiring your consent), you may request that we cease such processing by contacting us via the ‘How To Contact Us’ facility referred to below at section 17. Please note that if you withdraw your consent to such processing, it may not be possible for us to provide all/part of the Service to you.</p>
			
			<h2>9. Who we share your information with</h2>
			<p>We will not share Your Data without your consent or unless required by law (except as set out in this Privacy Policy). If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some of all of its assets, Your Data will not be transferred to any third party unless there are adequate safeguards in place with the recipient in respect of the security of Your Data.</p>
			<p>We restrict access to Your Data to employees, contractors, and agents of UBiqube or our Affiliates who need such access in order to operate, develop, or improve our Service. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We may also share Your Data with our third party suppliers who assist us in the provision of the Service.</p>
			<p>We also share Your Data with business partners, suppliers and subcontractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you (subject to having appropriate contracts in place with such third parties).&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Your Data may be transferred to, stored at, or accessed from a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) for the purposes of us providing the Service. It may also be processed by staff members operating outside the EEA who work for us, another corporate entity within our group, or any of our suppliers. By submitting Your Data, you explicitly consent to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your Data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The safeguards in place with regard to the transfer of Your Data outside of the EEA to third parties shall include (but shall not be limited to) the entry by us into appropriate contracts with all transferees of such data.</p>
			<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our (or contracted third party) secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access any part of our Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with any person not authorised to use the Service.</p>
			
			<h2>10. Third Party Websites</h2>
			<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites and services that are owned and operated by us. We do not exercise control over the sites/applications that may be linked from the Service, such as github.com. These other sites/applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. You acknowledge that the Service that we provide may enable or assist you to access the website content of, correspond with, and purchase goods and services from, third parties via third-party websites and that you do so solely at your own risk. We make no representation or commitment and shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever in relation to the content or use of, or correspondence with, any such third-party website, or any transactions completed, and any contract entered into by you, with any such third party and the use by any such third-party of your Personal Data.&nbsp; We do not endorse or approve any third-party website nor the content of any of the third-party website made available via the Service. We encourage you to carefully familiarise yourself with the terms of use and privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties.&nbsp;</p>
			
			<h2>11. Offensive Content</h2>
			<p>If Your Data contains any material which may reasonably be deemed to be offensive, inappropriate or objectionable or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour in relation to the Service, we may remove such content and/or suspend the use of Your Account. We may also remove any such material from any of our social media pages.</p>
			<p>Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws, for example on hate speech, we may disclose your personal information to relevant third parties, including to law enforcement agencies or your internet provider. We would only do so in circumstances where such disclosure is permitted under applicable laws, including Data Protection Legislation.</p>
			
			<h2>12. How do we protect your personal information</h2>
			<p>We do our utmost to protect user privacy through the appropriate use of security technology. We restrict access to Your Data to employees, contractors and agents who need to know Your Data in order to operate, develop or improve the services that we provide. We ensure that we have appropriate physical and technological security measures to protect your information; and we ensure that when we outsource any processes that the service provider has appropriate security measures in place. However, our Service may contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We will implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing of Your Data. In particular, we will consider the risks presented by accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Your Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect Your Data, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted to us and any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. To the extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or any other loss or damage resulting from (i) the transfer of data over communications networks and facilities, including the internet, or (ii) any delay or delivery failure on the part of any other service provider not contracted by us, and you acknowledge that our Service may be subject to limitations, delays and other problems inherent in the use of such communications facilities. You will appreciate that we cannot guarantee the absolute prevention of cyber-attacks such as hacking, spyware and viruses. Accordingly, you will not hold us liable for any unauthorized disclosure, loss or destruction of Your Data arising from such risks.</p>
			
			<h2>13. Breach Reporting</h2>
			<p>We will notify serious data breaches in respect of Your Data to the DPC without undue delay, and where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of the same. If notification is not made after 72 hours, we will record a reasoned justification for the delay; however, it is not necessary to notify the DPC where the Personal Data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. A Personal Data breach in this context means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>We will keep a record of any data breaches, including their effects and the remedial action taken, and will notify you of any data breach affecting your Personal Data (which poses a high risk to you) when we are required to do so under Data Protection Legislation. We will not be required to notify you of a data breach where:</p>
			<ul class="list-default">
			<li>we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures that render the Personal Data unintelligible to anyone not authorised to access it, such as encryption; or</li>
			<li>we have taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to data subjects is not likely to materialise; or</li>
			<li>it would involve disproportionate effort, in which case we may make a public communication instead.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>14 .Retention of Personal Data</h2>
			<p>Your Data will be kept and stored for such a period of time as we deem necessary taking into account the purpose for which it was collected in the first instance. This may include retaining Your Data as necessary to administer Your Account, comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Service.</p>
			<p>Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Service, not to specifically analyse personal characteristics about you.</p>
			
			<h2>15. Amendments to Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time and at our sole discretion. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on the top of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use the Service to submit Your Data. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our Service or by sending you a notification in relation to this. We will not process Your Data in a manner not contemplated by this Privacy Policy without your consent.</p>
			
			<h2>16. How to contact Us</h2>
			<p>If you need to contact us with regard to any of your rights as set out in this Privacy Policy, all such requests should be made in writing by email to <a href="mailto:privacy@ubiqube.com">privacy@ubiqube.com</a>.</p>
